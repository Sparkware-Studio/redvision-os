# 💖What's new in RedvisionOS 1.3?
<strong>• New interface</strong>  
> We decided to change the system interface and make it more traditional.
<hr>
<strong>• RedApps redesigned suite of applications</strong>

> There is no more need for RLang, because from now on RedApps selects the language automatically, following the current system language. Also meet Winori, your personal assistant and conversationalist (in an early version for now).
<hr>
<strong>• New package list</strong>

> Gaming, office, home - now RedvisionOS is suitable for absolutely everyone (not just gamers). 
Clarification: RedvisionOS was aimed more at a gaming distribution for games, we just decided to create everything for all groups of people.

<hr>
<strong>• Small, but nevertheless significant changes</strong>

>- Bluetooth and printers are now available immediately when you install the system without installing additional drivers.
<hr>
<strong>• Bug fixes</strong>

>sgdm is no longer needed to activate the shell
<hr>
<strong>• Improved system security</strong>
